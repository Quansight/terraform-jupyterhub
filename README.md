# Terraforming Jupyterhub

Placeholder for Quansight to soon open source the jupyterhub
deployment for scipy 2020 talk.

# Summary

Deploying and maintaining a jupyterhub cluster for teams is a
difficult task. â€‹We demonstrate an open source project
https://github.com/Quansight/terraform-jupyterhub that Quansight is
developing to automate through infrastructure as code the deployment
and day-to-day maintenance of jupyterhub on cloud providers: AWS, GCP,
and Digital Ocean. This project provides features for teams including:
managing multiple conda environments, credential management for users,
and a shared file system between users. The goal of this work is to
prove small institutions and groups the ability to provision and
manage in a cost effective manner a scalable compute environment for
teams.
